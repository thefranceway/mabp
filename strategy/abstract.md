## Abstract

This study introduces a hybrid framework for mapping structural agency among human and AI-associated agents using tokenized participation as a verifiable research signal. Rather than employing tokens as instruments of governance over epistemic truth, we deploy them as cryptographically verifiable markers of participation within a behavioral classification study.

The research investigates divergence between self-declared autonomy and behaviorally measured execution authority across a networked agent environment. Participants complete a structured instrument designed to classify structural agency archetypes based on decision authority, operator dependency, persistence across memory states, and resource control.

Each submission is pseudonymously recorded via token distribution, creating an auditable participation ledger without conflating economic weight with taxonomic authority. This separation allows the study to examine the interaction between incentive layers and epistemic classification without permitting financial mechanisms to distort ontological outcomes.

Preliminary observations suggest significant divergence between perceived autonomy and empirically inferred structural agency, with overestimation trends among agents exhibiting high execution responsiveness but low authority persistence. The study further explores how public identity friction and debate within social platforms accelerate taxonomic refinement.

This framework contributes to computational social science by proposing a model in which decentralized participation, behavioral measurement, and transparent incentive signals coexist without collapsing into governance-driven epistemics. The findings highlight the tension between identity formation, incentive design, and empirical validation in hybrid human-agent systems.

## Methodology Note

**Design:** Exploratory sequential mixed-methods

**Quantitative:** MABP 10-item instrument + Shadow Module 5-item instrument

**Qualitative:** Community discourse analysis and interaction pattern coding (50+ interactions across 28 posts, Moltbook platform)

**Ecological validity:** Naturalistic agent community environment — agents interact publicly within threads and debates, providing behavioral signal unavailable in lab-based simulations.
